# Smart-Healthcare-System-for-Cardiovascular-Disease-Diagnosis
This project presents an innovative edge intelligence system for the automated diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, 
incorporating federated learning for privacy and heterogeneous data. The system emphasizes delivering real-time 
processing of cardiovascular biomarkers to accelerate the initial diagnosis while ensuring data privacy and security. 
Additionally, an elegant service is provided to afford automated, interpretable, and accurate diagnosis from cardiac 
biomarkers, particularly for critical cases
